# Introduction to Data Structures

## What is Data Structure?
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. It refers to the logical or mathematical representation of data, as well as the implementation in a computer program.

## Importance of Data Structures
1. **Efficiency**: Proper data structures optimize memory usage and improve algorithm performance.
2. **Reusability**: Well-defined data structures can be reused across multiple programs.
3. **Abstraction**: They provide a clear and logical way to represent data, making it easier to understand and manipulate.
4. **Problem-Solving**: Choosing the right data structure is crucial for solving complex problems efficiently.

## Types of Data Structures
Data structures can be broadly classified into two categories:

### 1. Primitive Data Structures
These are basic data structures provided by programming languages. Examples include:
- **Integer**
- **Float**
- **Character**
- **Boolean**

### 2. Non-Primitive Data Structures
These are complex data structures derived from primitive data types. They are further divided into:

#### **Linear Data Structures**
Elements are arranged in a sequential order.
- **Arrays**: A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Linked Lists**: A sequence of nodes where each node points to the next node.
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List
- **Stacks**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure where elements are added and removed from the top.
- **Queues**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
  - Circular Queue
  - Priority Queue
  - Double-Ended Queue (Deque)

#### **Non-Linear Data Structures**
Elements are not arranged sequentially.
- **Trees**: A hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes.
  - Binary Trees
  - Binary Search Trees (BST)
  - Balanced Trees (AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees)
  - Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- **Graphs**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
  - Directed and Undirected Graphs
  - Weighted and Unweighted Graphs
- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: A tree-like structure used for storing strings efficiently.
- **Hash Tables**: A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function.

#### **Advanced Data Structures**
These are specialized data structures used for specific use cases.
- **Segment Trees**: Used for range queries and updates.
- **Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees)**: Used for efficient prefix sum calculations.
- **Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)**: Used for managing partitions of a set.
- **Splay Trees**: Self-adjusting binary search trees.
- **B-Trees and B+ Trees**: Used in databases and file systems for efficient storage and retrieval.
